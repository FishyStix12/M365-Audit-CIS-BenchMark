The script aims to streamline the evaluation of M365 configurations against the CIS Benchmark, ensuring compliance with security best practices and enhancing the overall security posture. This script will output the results of the tested controls into a text file, and format the output to be user friendly. <br />
**2. M365-Admin-Center.ps1 -** This PowerShell script automates the assessment of Microsoft 365 Admin Center (M365) configurations against specific security and compliance controls, as defined by the CIS M365 Benchmark. It performs tasks such as importing and managing required modules, verifying administrative account configurations, checking global administrator count, evaluating license assignments for privileged users, assessing public group approvals, and auditing critical tenant-wide settings like password expiration, external calendar sharing, and the customer lockbox feature. Each control's results are compiled into detailed reports stored in a central location. The script also manages cleanup processes to maintain a clean environment.
