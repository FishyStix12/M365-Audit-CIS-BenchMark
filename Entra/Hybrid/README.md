1. Windows-AD&Entra-HybridEligibilityChecker.ps1 - helps support a multi-stage hybrid join rollout into Entra by separating Windows 11 and Windows Server devices. It allows you to onboard in phases, making it easier to test, track, and manage device readiness. By checking OS versions and grouping devices, it enables targeting through Entra groups for things like Intune auto-enrollment and policy assignments tied to hybrid-joined status.<br />
