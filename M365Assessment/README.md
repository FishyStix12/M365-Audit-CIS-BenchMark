**Description of Scripts Below:**
1. `M365Testversion-7-2.ps1` - The provided PowerShell script is designed to run on PowerShell version 7.2 and to support auditing and management of Microsoft 365 environments based on Version 4.0 of the CIS M365 Benchmark. It defines a custom module path and installs essential PowerShell modules, including Az, PnP.PowerShell, AzureAD, MSOnline, and ExchangeOnlineManagement, to facilitate automated security assessments. The script aims to streamline the evaluation of M365 configurations against the CIS Benchmark, ensuring compliance with security best practices and enhancing the overall security posture. <br />
2. `M365Assessment/Admin_Users_P1P2_License_Check.ps1/M365Assessment/Admin_Users_P1P2_License_Check_v2.ps1` - This script audits all Azure AD roles containing "Admin" or "Administrator" in their names. It filters to include only user objects (excluding service accounts and apps), and reports which users are missing P1 or P2 licenses. Version 2 of the script uses the new MgGraph Powershell Module as the AzureAD and MSOnline modules have been depricated. <br />
